** Features

This is why you should consider using Dark-GitLab!

- Custom regex and included support for well-known public GitLab instances
  - Easy to add your private GitLab instance. âš  Editing the code locally
    will prevent auto-update from working. See [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/issues/99#note_265480670][#99]] for more information.
  - Found a public instance that's not already on the list? Make a MR!

** Installation

You have to install [[https://add0n.com/stylus.html][Stylus]] and then click on the install link below.

[[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/raw/master/gitlab.user.styl][https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat]]

*** Initial configuration

Dark-GitLab works best with /default/ settings as it tries to be uniform across
all instances that you might find on the web. Therefore, for the best experience
set the following in the [[https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences][preferences]] on instances you're logged in:
  - Set syntax highlighting theme set to =white=
  - Set navigation theme to =indigo=
  - Set layout to =fixed= if want to use "custom width for fixed layout" option

To customize colors and/or other features, follow these instructions:
  - Open the Stylus extension popup while you're on any page Dark-GitLab is
    active on, or from the Manage page in Stylus. Click on the cogwheel icon and
    that'll open up a menu from which you can customize the available options.
  - Additionally, install [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][dark-switcher]] if you'd like to quickly switch between
    various pre-defined color-schemes.

*** Other ways to install this userstyle

Supported but _not recommended_.

**** /Stylish/ is only supported through /[[https://userstyles.org/styles/164877][userstyles.org]]/

USo is still the largest repository for themes despite all the issues. Don't
use this version unless you /absolutely/ have to.

It only has core functionality, is (likely) outdated, has no support, and needs
to be /manually/ compiled for every single update.
