** Features
This is why you should consider using Dark-GitLab!

- Fully customizable color-scheme through Stylus configuration menu
  - Supports dark and light color-schemes, and works great with [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][dark-switcher]].
- Custom regex and included support for well-known public GitLab instances
  - Easy to add your private GitLab instance. :warning: Editing the code locally
    will prevent auto-update from working. See [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/issues/99#note_265480670][#99]] for more information.
  - Found a public instance that's not already on the list? Make a MR!

** Installation

You have to install [[https://add0n.com/stylus.html][Stylus]] and then click on the install link below.

[[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/raw/master/gitlab.user.styl][https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat]]

*** Base configuration
- Change [[https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences][GitLab preferences]] because Dark-GitLab is meant to be used both when
  the user is signed in and signed out. Therefore, for the best experience set
  the following in preferences:
  - Set syntax highlighting theme set to =white=
  - Set navigation theme to =indigo=
  - Set layout to =fixed= if want to use "custom width for fixed layout" option
- Further customization:
  - Open the Stylus extension popup while you're on any page this userstyle is
    active or from the Manage page in Stylus, click on the cogwheel icon and
    that'll open up a menu from which you can customize userstyle options.
  - Additionally, install [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][dark-switcher]] if you'd like to quickly switch between
    various pre-defined color-schemes.

*** Other ways to install this userstyle
**** /Stylish/ is only supported through /[[https://userstyles.org/styles/164877][userstyles.org]]/
USo is still the largest repository for themes despite all the issues. Don't
use this version unless you /absolutely/ have to.

It only has core functionality, is (likely) outdated, has no support, and needs
to be /manually/ compiled for every single update.
