** 1.0.0 [2020-04-14]
The rewrite is complete.

This update removes styles for all sub-domains except =next.gitlab.com=, and some
of the custom options. There are too many things to cover, so I'm not going to
do that, but you can go through all 489 commits in [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/-/merge_requests/30][!30]] if you're interested.

Going forward, I'll explore adding some sub-domains/pages back. I rarely use
them to justify putting a lot of effort into making them dark, and DarkReader
will do a decent job anyways.

Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for using this
userstyle and helping out with the project. Things wouldn't have been the same
without your help.
